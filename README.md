# Deployment of ML-models using web with python-flask.


#### Deploying simple linear regression model as REST API using flask

#### Deploying Dog breed classification model with docker using tensorflow serving
- Model is build using transfer learning technique in deep learning with mobilenet_v2. You can check the link [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ESIS6-1TENYy3jObzVUGgwOtW2Iy8yqi?usp=sharing) for the code to build the model itself. 
- the model used in the deployment is trained with only 1000 images for simplicity.

Happy Learning!!!
