# Deployment of ML-models.


#### Deploying simple linear regression model as REST API using flask
- Model is trained on simply dataset consisting of Years of experience and salary(being the target variable)
- Model predicts salary given the input years of experience with a simple web app build with python-flask as back-end

#### Deploying Dog breed classification model with docker using tensorflow serving
- Model is build using transfer learning technique in deep learning with mobilenet_v2. You can check the link [here](https://github.com/Mattobad/Data-Science/blob/master/DeepLearning/End_to_end_dog_breed_classification.ipynb) for the code to build the model itself. 
- the model used in the deployment is trained with only 1000 images for simplicity.

Happy Learning!!!
